So I have this key signing service, but it's next to this big.. glowy thing.
If I ask it to sign the same thing twice, I sometimes get different results!

I don't think I have a bug in my code.. all I do is
 d = radioactive_storage.load("d")
 n = radioactive_storage.load("n")
 g = int(raw_input())
 return pow(g, d, n), n

I attached a log of what I mean, maybe it will help you diagnose the issue.
